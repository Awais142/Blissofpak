                I am a repeat customer of the Ancient Greek Remedy line of
                products. Because I like and use all the products contained in
                the gift box, that is what I usually order on Amazon. The foot
                balm, meant for softening rough spots on feet, is also good as a
                general body moisturizer. The bottle of oil says on the label
                that it is for face, skin, hair, nails. When my hair is damp dry
                from the shower I spread 6 to 8 drops through my hair and smush
                it around and it gives my hair instant manageability. The butter
                cream (no butter in it, just pure organic olive oil and natural
                herbal oils) is wonderful as a general skin moisturizer, and the
                pumice stone included gets rid of any calluses on the heels.
                Last but not least, there are two bars of soap included. I don't
                even use a washcloth, just rub the bar all over. To me, the soap
                is superior to any other soap on the market today. My skin feels
                clean and nourished. Each of these products contained in the
                gift box is good for both men and women, but I feel like I have
                been shopping at a good spa selecting what to use during and
                after my daily shower. I can recommend the gift box without any
                reservation. I have received absolutely nothing either from
                Amazon or the Bliss company, maker of the products, for this
                recommendation.

                I have aging dry skin ('I'm 61) and there's not enough regular
                moisturizer to combat it. I found that by applying a natural oil
                underneath my regular moisturizer helps a lot to keep my face in
                that dewy glow all day. But the search for the right oil - one
                that didn't clog pores, with NATURAL oils without additional
                crap in it, wasn't easy. Then I my search somehow led me to
                Greek Bliss. BINGO! All of the ingredients (especially olive
                oil) have been proven to help with any kind of skin condition
                and hair for that matter. Grape seed is a good ingredient too.
                My make-up no longer ends up cakey either. Point being, all
                these ingredients by far are the very best for your skin and
                hair. Look no further...this is the oil you want.

                I am so pleasantly surprised with this oil! I have had a hard
                time finding a moisturizer for my combination skin, but this has
                been amazing! I purchased this in the beginning of October and
                wanted to wait to post a review until I saw the effects on my
                skin. The oil is so light (I only use one half squirt) and it
                covers my entire face. I hardly notice I put it on after a few
                minutes. After the first couple applications my face was greasy,
                but not nearly like using the lotion most cosmetic brands put
                out there. Now my skin has evened out, most of the redness has
                left my dried cheeks and I no longer have Whiteheads/closed
                Comedones. I also received this package within 2 business days
                as I had expected.

                Thank you, Bliss of Greece. It has really been blissful to try
                your product. Also, this review was not written for compensation
                of any kind, I am genuinely happy to share this product.
